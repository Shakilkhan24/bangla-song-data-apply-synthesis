Poran Fokir,দয়াল তোমারও লাগিয়া যোগিনী সাজিব,"দয়াল তোমারও লাগিয়া যোগিনী সাজিব

তুমি কোনবা দেশে রইলারে দয়াল চান

তোমায় না দেখলে বাঁচে না আমার প্রাণ

তুমি কোনবা দেশে রইলারে দয়াল চান

দয়াল তোমারও লাগিয়া যোগিনী সাজিব।

আমি সঁইপা দিব আমার মন ও প্রাণ

তুমি কোনবা দেশে রইলারে দয়াল চান

দয়াল তোমারও লাগিয়া দেশে না বৈদেশে।

আমি পাইতাছি পিরিতির ফল।

তুমি কোনবা দেশে রইলারে দয়াল চান

যেমন শিমুলের তুলা বাতাসে ওড়ে রে।

তুমি সেই মতো উড়াইলা আমার প্রাণ।

তুমি কোনবা দেশে রইলারে দয়াল চান।।","Excellent song lyrics! It captures the deep yearning and devotional longing (""দিন"") beautifully. Here's a creative prompt designed to generate similar Bangla devotional/folk songs, focusing on expanding the emotional and narrative depth while maintaining the lyrical simplicity:

**Creative Prompt:**

**Title:** বিরহিনীর আর্তনাদ (Birohinir Artonad - A Separated Lover's Cry)

**Concept:** A female devotee (বাউল or otherwise), separated from her beloved divine figure (""দয়াল""), expresses her pain and unwavering devotion through song. The song should explore the themes of longing, sacrifice, and the search for divine connection, drawing inspiration from nature and rural Bengali life.

**Instructions for Lyric and Melody Generation:**

1.  **Emotional Focus:**
    *   **Intensity of Longing:** The song should express an overwhelming sense of separation and the burning desire to be reunited with the ""দয়াল"". Think beyond just sadness; incorporate feelings of desperation, confusion, and even a touch of rebellious questioning. (""কেন দূরে রাখো মোরে?"" - Why do you keep me away?)
    *   **Sacrifice and Devotion:** Emphasize the sacrifices the devotee is willing to make to attain union. Consider traditional symbols of renunciation (like becoming a ""যোগিনী"", as in the original) and how she is giving up her worldly life for divine love.
    *   **Nature as Metaphor:** Use vivid imagery from rural Bengal (rivers, fields, birds, seasons) to represent the devotee's emotional state. For example, a parched field could represent her longing, a restless river could symbolize her ceaseless search, or a lonely bird's call could mirror her lament.

2.  **Lyrical Structure & Language:**
    *   **Simple and Direct:** Maintain the simple, accessible language characteristic of Baul and folk songs. Avoid complex vocabulary or overly ornate metaphors. Focus on clear, heartfelt expression.
    *   **Repetition and Refrain:**  Like the original, use repetition effectively to emphasize key emotions and ideas. A recurring refrain, perhaps with slight variations, can create a powerful impact.
    *   **Questioning and Yearning:** Incorporate questions directed towards the ""দয়াল"".  Don't be afraid to express doubt or frustration alongside devotion. This adds a layer of human complexity.
    *   **Bangla Vocabulary:** Use common Bangla words relating to love, loss, separation, devotion, and nature. Use proverbs where appropriate.
    *   **Rhyme and Rhythm:**  Employ a simple, flowing rhyme scheme and a rhythm that lends itself to easy singing and memorization.  Bengali folk tunes often have a characteristic lilt.

3.  **Narrative Prompts (Choose 1 or Combine Elements):**

    *   **The Journey:**  The devotee is actively searching for the ""দয়াল,"" traveling through different landscapes (physical and metaphorical) and encountering obstacles along the way.  Describe these encounters and how they affect her resolve.
    *   **The Dream:**  The devotee has a vivid dream or vision of the ""দয়াল"" that intensifies her longing and provides clues to his whereabouts (which may be more symbolic than literal).
    *   **The Offering:**  The devotee offers up her most prized possessions (material or emotional) as a sacrifice to the ""দয়াল"" in the hope of gaining his attention and grace. What are these possessions, and what do they represent?
    *   **The Reflection:** The devotee looks back on happier times with the ""দয়াল"" and contrasts them with her current state of separation. This could be a memory of a shared song, a shared experience in nature, or a moment of profound spiritual connection.

4.  **Specific Bangla Phrases and Imagery to Consider:**

    *   ""বিরহ"" (Biroho - Separation/Longing)
    *   ""অন্তর"" (Ontor - Heart)
    *   ""পাগলিনী"" (Pagalini - Madwoman, often used to describe someone intensely devoted)
    *   ""রাধা"" (Radha - The archetypal lover of Krishna, a symbol of intense devotion)
    *   ""নদী"" (Nodi - River, representing the flow of life and the search for union)
    *   ""মাঝি"" (Majhi - Boatman, representing guidance and the journey across life's river)
    *   ""বাউল বেশ"" (Baul Besh - The attire of a Baul, signifying renunciation)
    *   ""ফকিরি"" (Fokiri - Asceticism/Devotion)
    *   ""মন পাহিয়া"" (Mon Pahiya - To get the heart/mind)
    *   ""পিরিতি"" (Piriti - Love/Affection)

**Example Prompt (Combining Elements):**

""Compose a song from the perspective of a 'পাগলিনী' searching for her 'দয়াল' across the vast riverbanks of Bengal.  She has had a dream where he appeared as a shimmering light on the other side of the river. Now she searches tirelessly, offering her tears as a sacrifice to the river, hoping it will carry her to him. Use imagery of the river, the lonely birds that fly above, and the setting sun to express her growing despair and unwavering faith.""
